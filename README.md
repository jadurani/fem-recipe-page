## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS (CDN)

### What I learned

Using tailwind as a CDN with a custom config. I've only used config before on top of frameworks like Angular and Next.js, I thought it'd be interesting to know use it in plain HTML. It's a cute exercise.
